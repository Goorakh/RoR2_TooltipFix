# TooltipFix

Fixes UI tooltips not appearing if they are missing a description.

This is a bug introduced in the v1.3.2 patch, where tooltips were changed to not be shown unless they had both a title and a description. The problem is that some tooltips do not have descriptions, such as skins in the character select, causing them to not display.
